Questions
1. There was a hacking incident recently, has the CC figured out the perpetrators?
2. Whose responsibility is it to maintain the institute website? Specifically, who fixed the website after it was hacked?
3. To make the ID card, CC collects a lot of data, some of which is only slightly relevant to the process. Who owns that data?
4. Does CC share ID card pictures with the PClub?
5. Is there a way we can have public (accessible to PClub) and private folders?
